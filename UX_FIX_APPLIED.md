# Quick Fix Applied! 🎉

## What Was Wrong:
After recording audio, you saw "Audio processed!" but no way to make a prediction without manually switching tabs.

## What's Fixed Now:

### ✅ **"Make Prediction Now" Button Automatically Appears!**

After you record or upload audio, you'll now see:

```
✅ Audio processed! 22 speech features extracted.

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🧠 Make Prediction Now                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Or switch to Manual/CSV tab to see all features
```

### How It Works Now:

1. **Record/Upload Audio** → Audio processed ✅
2. **"Make Prediction Now" button appears** 
3. **Click the button** → Prediction happens immediately!
4. **Results appear on the right** →

Same for handwriting:
1. **Upload Handwriting Image** → Image processed ✅
2. **"Make Prediction Now" button appears**
3. **Click button** → Instant prediction!
