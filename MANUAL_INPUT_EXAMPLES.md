## ‚úÖ Confirmation:

**The model IS working correctly!** 

- ‚úÖ Features are scaled properly
- ‚úÖ SVM model runs on every prediction
- ‚úÖ Different inputs give different results
- ‚úÖ Loading states show the model is processing
- ‚úÖ Server logs confirm model execution

**Copy the examples above and test them now!** üöÄ

## üí° Why Previous Examples Didn't Work:

The old examples had **completely wrong feature scales**:
- Old: `0.00289, 0.00245, -0.00456...` (MFCC-style features)
- Real: `241.621432, 203.412465, 150.145005...` (Actual frequency in Hz)

The model was trained on **real UCI Parkinson's dataset** with specific feature ranges, so only examples matching those ranges will work correctly!
