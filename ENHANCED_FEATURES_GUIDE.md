## üéØ How It Works

### Feature Extraction Pipeline:

```
1. AUDIO INPUT
   Audio Recording/File ‚Üí Feature Extraction ‚Üí 22 Speech Features
   - MFCC coefficients
   - Jitter (frequency variation)
   - Shimmer (amplitude variation)  
   - Pitch, energy, HNR

2. HANDWRITING INPUT
   Image Upload ‚Üí Feature Extraction ‚Üí 10 Handwriting Features
   - Pressure variations
   - Velocity and acceleration
   - Tremor frequency
   - Pen-up time
   - Fluency scores

3. GAIT DATA (Auto-generated for demo)
   Default Values ‚Üí 10 Gait Features
   - Stride length
   - Cadence
   - Asymmetry
   - Regularity

4. COMBINATION
   22 Speech + 10 Handwriting + 10 Gait = 42 Total Features

## üîß Technical Details

### Browser Requirements:
- **Microphone Recording:** Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari (requires HTTPS in production)
- **File Upload:** All modern browsers
- **Microphone Permission:** Must be granted by user

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/process_audio` - Extract speech features from audio
- `POST /api/process_handwriting` - Extract features from handwriting image
- `POST /api/predict` - Make prediction with combined features

### Feature Extraction:
- **Audio:** Uses librosa for speech analysis (currently simulated)
- **Handwriting:** Image processing and kinematic analysis (currently simulated)
- **Gait:** Auto-generated default values for demonstration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Demo Mode:** Feature extraction is currently simulated with realistic values. In production, actual signal processing would be implemented.

2. **Microphone Access:** Browser will ask for permission to access your microphone. This is required for recording.

3. **Privacy:** Audio and images are processed server-side and immediately deleted after feature extraction.

4. **File Sizes:** 
   - Audio: Max 10MB
   - Images: Max 5MB recommended

5. **For Clinical Use:** This is a research tool. Always consult healthcare professionals for diagnosis.
